<h2 id="aboutme">About me</h2>
Hi, I'm **Younho Jeon**, an M.S. graduate in Computer Science from KAIST, where I conducted research at the Neuro-Machine Augmented Intelligence Laboratory (NMAIL) under the supervision of Prof. Sungho Jo.

My research primarily focused on human motion analysis using various sensors. I investigated methods for reconstructing human motion from sensor data and developed efficient techniques for visualizing motion data.

I am also interested in 2D/3D Computer Vision and Diffusion Models. I am exploring ways to integrate motion and vision-based diffusion models to develop AI-driven solutions for tasks such as motion generation and 3D scene understanding.
